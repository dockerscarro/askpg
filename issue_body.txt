The current implementation of the store system works for basic operations, but there are several issues and areas for improvement. The cart total calculation handles only flat discounts and does not support percentage-based or multiple discount types, and discounts that exceed the total are simply set to zero without notifying the customer. Stock management checks availability when adding items to the cart, but it does not allow partial additions if the requested quantity exceeds stock, and concurrent checkouts could lead to overselling. Cart behavior could be improved by allowing direct quantity updates, providing a cart summary with itemized totals, and enabling removal of specific quantities rather than entire items. Orders currently only have a Pending status and do not track shipping, delivery, or cancellations, and the total amount does not reflect discounts applied at checkout. Additionally, input validation is minimal, with no checks for negative prices, quantities, or stock, and error messages could be more descriptive. Suggested improvements include supporting multiple discount types, validating discount amounts, adding a detailed cart summary, allowing partial stock additions, enhancing order status tracking, improving input validation and error handling, and optionally implementing concurrency-safe stock management. For example, a customer trying to add 10 units of a product with only 6 in stock, applying a 50% discount to a multi-item cart, and placing an order should see the stock correctly reduced and the order total reflect the discount, while order history accurately records item quantities and discounts.
